android-demo-client
===================

The Flask server app for my talk on Android WebViews and Java/Javascript Injection

See the [client repo](http://github.com/thatryana/android-demo-client/) for the Android client app.

Usage
=====

Visit '/set/<query>' in a browser with the server running to set the query that will be used to query
the Google Image Search when '/' is accessed.

Accessing '/' from the [client app](http://github.com/thatryana/android-demo-client/) will allow the
user to tap on an image to view some of its json data in a Native TableView.
